# Working with R ----

# Everything with a hashtag before it is not read as code - hastags are used for making comments throughout your code. 
# Comments can be super helpful. It can be hard to keep track of exactly what your code is doing otherwise.

## Loading in data the codeless way ----

# Let's start by opening an Excel 'File': 'Vowels_to_plot.xlsx':
# `File` -> `Import Dataset` -> `From Excel...`
# Now look at the console window in the bottom left quadrant of RStudio
# You should see some code
# You can copy this into your Script (but delete the greater than symbol '>' at the beginning). Try it below:



# To run the code, highlight it and click 'Ctrl'/'Cmd' and 'Enter'/'Return' or click 'Run



# If you are working with a .csv file or .txt file, you can load that in by clicking:
# `File` -> `Import Dataset` -> `From Text (base)...`
# Again, you can copy this code into your R script, to work with in future. 

## Working directory ----

# Setting a working directory can be a bit of a pain. Who knows the path names for where things are saved.
# You can get around this by clicking 'Session' -> 'Set Working Directory As...' -> 'Choose Directory...'
# For this session, you want your working directory to be wherever you saved the files for this workshop.

# From this point on, if you want to run any code, you can copy and paste it here.
